# Efficiency: you can reuse a lot of code
# Flexibility: while reusing, you can still adapt it partially or completely to
# the context
# Organization: classes and modules make code look and work in a more organized
# fashion

#Summary of given answer

# - Benefits of OOP:
#   - creating objects allows for more abstract thinking
#   - objects represented as nouns are easier to conceptualize
#   - allows us to only expose the functionality that we want to
#   - allows us to give functionality to different parts without duplication
#   - we can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code
#   - complexity can be more easily managed
